  <md:title>Trade Policy in the Trump Era: A Debate</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Traditionally, American presidents have supported free trade--or at least less restricted trade.  But the new administration has invoked tariffs and possible renegotiation of longstanding trade agreements. Academic economists are all but unanimous on the benefits of free trade, but a few dissenters say free traders live in a fantasy land, ignoring economic reality. In this debate,  Dr. Michael Hudson of University of Missouri Kansas City and Peking University and Dr. Farhad Rassekh of the University of Hartford debate whether the US should pursue a policy of free trade or protectionism.</md:abstract>
